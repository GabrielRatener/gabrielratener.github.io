		My name is Gabe, I am a 24 year-old freelance web developer, currently based out of Las Vegas. I completed my BS in Atmospheric Science and Math in 2014 and my Masters in Computer Science in 2017.

		Through my college years I started building websites for several clients. I also taught Math and Programming classes to K-12 students during the summer.

		I most recently worked as a JavaScript programmer and Front-end developer at a Seattle based startup for 6 months in 2017.

		After leaving my job I've been travelling around Mexico and Central America for the last several months.
