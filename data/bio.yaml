about: |
  I am a freelance software developer originally from Seattle.
  I completed my BS in Atmospheric Science and Math in 2014, and my Masters in Computer Science in 2017.

  During my college years I began freelancing and working on websites for several clients.
  I also taught math and programming to K-12 students over the summer.

  After graduating in 2017, I became lead front-end developer at the
  Kirkland-based children's event networking startup Social Rugrats for the better part of a year.

  After leaving my job I traveled around Mexico and Central America for several months, while working various odd jobs.

  Since July 2018 I've been working as lead software developer at KLIK Boks a Bellevue-based startup
  developing next-generation wireless presentation and collaboration technologies.
